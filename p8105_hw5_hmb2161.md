iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))

    y = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)             # take the mean of the column x and save it as a value y
    x = replace(x, is.na(x), y)           # then replace any missing values in column x with the value y
