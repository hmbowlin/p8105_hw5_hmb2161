# Problem 2: plot

``` r
# creating a spaghetti plot for the dataframe created above with week on the x axis, observations on the y axis, grouped by subject, with the color as the treatment arm

plot_ppt_data = 
  ggplot(prob_data, aes(x = week, y = observations, color = group, group = subject)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = subject)) +
  geom_line() +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(aes(color = group), discrete = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Participant Observations Over Weeks By Treatment Group",
    x = "Weeks",
    y = "Observation Values"
  )

plot_ppt_data
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_hmb2161_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

The resulting plot shows the observation values for each participant
over the course of 8 weeks. The control group appear to have lower
observation values across weeks of the study compared to the
experimental arm. The participants generally start from a similar
baseline (the groups are overlapped), but as the trial moves forward,
the measurements get much higher for the experimental group and stay
about the same for the control group.

# Problem 3

# creating an equation simulation for n = 30, beta0 = 2, and beta1 = 0

sim_regression = function(n = 30, beta0 = 2, beta1 = 0) {
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 1, sd = 1),
    y = beta0 + beta1 * x + rnorm(n, 0, 50)    
  )
  
  ls_fit = lm(y ~ x, data = sim_data) %>%
    broom::tidy() %>%
    select(term, estimate, p.value)

}

# creating a dataframe with the regression simulation run 10,000 times for beta1 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} including p-values and estimated beta1 value

models = 
  tibble(beta1 = 0:6) %>%
  mutate(reg_data = map(.x = beta1, ~rerun(10000, sim_regression(beta1 = .x))),
         estimate_dfs = map(reg_data, bind_rows)) %>%
  select(-reg_data) %>%
  unnest(estimate_dfs)

# showing an example few rows of my simulation results

knitr::kable(head(models))

## Problem 3: Null Rejection by Beta1

``` r
# creating a dataframe grouped by beta1 and summarized by the p-value > 0.05 with a proportion of times I rejected the null

models_reject = 
  models %>%
  group_by(beta1) %>%
  count(reject = p.value < 0.05) %>%
  mutate(reject_pct = n/sum(n) * 100) %>%
  filter(reject == TRUE)
  
# creating graph of when we rejected the null against the beta1 value 

rejected_null = 
ggplot(models_reject, aes(x = beta1, 
                          y = reject_pct, 
                          color = reject_pct)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(aes(color = reject_pct), 
                               discrete = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Percent of Null Rejection by Beta 1",
       x = "Beta 1",
       y = "Percent of Rejected Null" )

rejected_null
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_hmb2161_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />
As the effect size (beta1) gets larger, the percent of times the null is
rejected increases, so the power
increases.

## Problem 3: Average Beta1 vs true Beta1

``` r
# taking the models dataset, grouping by beta1, and taking the average of the beta1

models_avg = 
  models %>%
  group_by(beta1) %>%
  summarize(avg_beta1 = mean(estimate))

# graphing the average beta1 by color

average_beta1 = 
  ggplot(models_avg, aes(x = beta1, y = avg_beta1, color = beta1)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
    viridis::scale_color_viridis(aes(color = reject_pct), 
                               discrete = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Avg Beta1 Compared to True Beta1",
       x = "True Beta 1",
       y = "Average Beta 1" )
